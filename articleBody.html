<h1>Introduction to Git for Non-Programmers</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Version Control</span> is the process
of recording the history of changes to files as they are
modified.&nbsp;
Users can go back in time and get old versions and identify where
changes were introduced (people sometimes refer to version control
tools as time machines). This mean that it is easier to<br>
<ul>
  <li>Protect against 'accidental' changes and get a known good version
of a file back</li>
  <li>Have more than one person working on changes at once (programmers
refer to this as parallel development)</li>
  <li>Get an older set of files that may be requested by a customer or
manager<br>
  </li>
</ul>
The first version control (VC)&nbsp; tool, <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Control_System">SCCS</a>,
was written in 1972 and since that time there has a some major advances
in the way tools are used. Git represents the current 'state of the
art' in that it is distributed <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial_%28software%29">(Mercurial</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazaar_software">Bazaar</a>&nbsp;
are examples of other open source distributed VC tools). A distributed
VC tool gives each user a complete history of all changes to the files
which they work on and make further changes. Later all changes can be
merged together over the computer network into a common thread for
release or further work. Whilst this sounds complicated the tool makes
it relatively easy and error free.<br>
<br>
Other well know VC tools, for example <a
 href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/index.html">Subversion</a>,
are classed as centralised and provide only a single place (repository)
into which all users put the changes on a regular basis. In this model
users do not have a personal copy of the change history, they only have
the set of the files they currently working with. Git also has a some
plug-ins to allow it it be a local client to a remote repository
maintained by other tools such as <a
 href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-svn.html">Subversion</a>
so you can be a Git user and still work on projects that use those
tools.<br>
<br>
Git runs on Windows, OS/X, Linux and UNIX.<br>
<br>
This article presents Git and version control without assuming any
prior knowledge or programming experience. Because of it's introductory
nature certain details are simplified or ommitted and the use of the
Git Graphical User Interface (git-gui) is emphasied.<br>
<h2>Concepts</h2>
Git maintains a dabase of all previous file versions in a repository
(repo) and it is located&nbsp; in a directory called .git (in UNIX
style systems names that begin with a . are not displayed by default so
the repo is usually not visible during normal work). As well the
contents of the files and directory versions there is additional
housekeeping information about current work, other remote repostories
we are sharing with, current settings and so on. In Git we have a
seperate repo for each of our projects (websites for instance)<br>
<br>
As well as the repo there is the current set of working files that are
we are working on and editing. As we complete changes to our working
files we add the changes to the repo -- this is called commiting
changes. In actually fact we are not fully committed as we can always
get old versions back and make changes to the changes. We can also get
a summary of our current changes against previous versions to see what
we have done so far. The set of files we are currently working is
called the working copy. We can easily change the working copy to a
different version whenever we want.<br>

Before progressing any further let's install Git and set up a small
test repo to work with.<br>
<h2>Installing Git</h2>
If you use Linux then installing should be a simple matter of using
your package manager to install git (and possibly gitgui&nbsp; if it's
a seperate package). For Apple OS/X either use the <a
 href="http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/">installer</a> or
you can use <a href="http://github.com/guides/get-git-on-mac">Mac Ports</a>.
Windows users who also use Cygwin can use the Git from Cygwin, use the
Cygwin setup.exe package manger to install the appropriate packages.
Other Windows users should use the the native Windows Git package<br>
<br>
<h3>Special Notes for Windows Users</h3>
If you do not use Cygwin or <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PuTTY">Putty</a>, then accept all
defaults during the install. You&nbsp; may care to make a single change
to that is to select "Run Git from the Windows Command Prompt"<br>
<h2>Starting to use Git</h2>
Locate the Gitgui command, either from a menu or by running git-gui
from the command line<img style="width: 499px; height: 378px;"

<br>
Select 'Create New Repostory'<br>
<br>
<br>
Enter a the name of a new directory. Git will create the directory and
initialise an empty repo <br>
